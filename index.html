									<h2><a href="https://github.com/zacklasek/NBASalaryProject/blob/main/NBASalary_Project.R">NBA SALARY<br />
									Analysis in R Studio</a></h2>
									<p>There is a common theme of NBA games nowadays: players missing games for "load management reasons". Many fans 
										are infuriated by this trend and question why players make so much money if they are not available 24/7. This project dives deeper
										into the correlation between certain stats and salaries. The analysis was completed in R using data cleaning, feature engineering, 
										and visualization techniques within the ggplot2 package.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="gallery">
									<p> First, I wanted to see the density of salaries to gain an understanding
										of the general distrubution:</p>
									<a href="images/NBASalary-Dist.png"><img src="images/NBASalary-Dist.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Next, I wanted to see which stats had the highest direct correlation to Salary:</p>
									<a href="images/NBASalaryCorrel.png"><img src="images/NBASalaryCorrel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Then I thought it would be important to illustrate that there is no
										notable relationship between games played and salary. I threw a mark of LeBron's
										salary in as a reference point (and I am a huge LeBron fan).</p>
									<a href="images/NBASalaryGP.png"><img src="images/NBASalaryGP.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> The next two graphs are examples of the two highest correlation variables and demonstrates
										the strong relationship between producing on the court and getting paid:

									<a href="images/NBASalaryPRA.png"><img src="images/NBASalaryPRA.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> To end my analysis I created a stat that calculates the minutes each player plays 
										for each dollar they make. This was done to see which players are the best bargain in terms
										of time on the court. A GM could use this stat to understand the durability and dedication
										of a specific player before any transaction with them.
									</p>
									<a href="images/Top10MinPerDol.png"><img src="images/Top10MinPerDol.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> In summary, my analysis reveals that the number of games played by a player does not strongly correlate with their salary. 
										This can be attributed to various factors such as production and statistics, like PRA and PPG, which carry significant weight. 
										Additionally, injuries and fatigue are influential factors. NBA franchises also consider the revenue generated by players, 
										including ticket and merchandise sales, as well as fan engagement and loyalty towards specific players. These combined factors, 
										alongside on-court performance, have the greatest impact on an NBA player's salary

									<h2><a href="#">NCAA Football<br />
									Conference Defense Analysis in Tableau</a></h2>
									<p>This analysis examines the factors contributing to the dominance of Power 5 conferences,
										 focusing on their defensive prowess. By plotting various defensive statistics against average wins per season, 
										 the analysis reveals a clear linear correlation between these variables and the average number of wins achieved
										  by teams within each conference.
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="gallery">
									<p> The first thing I did once I had my data cleaned and ready for analysis was to 
										look at the overall performances by conference throughout all years in the dataset (2017-2021):
									</p>
									<a href="images/RankByConference.png"><img src="images/RankByConference.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Next, I put the first variable I wanted to focus into a scatterplot with avg wins
										per season. This showed a linear correlation between wins and yds allowed per game:
									</p>
									<a href="images/YdsPerGame.png"><img src="images/YdsPerGame.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Then using my own football knowledge and understanding of how important it is to 
										control the running game, I decided to insert avg rushing yds allowed per game into the x-axis. This 
										showed another decently strong correlation with all Power 5 conferences near the top right of the graph:
									</p>
									<a href="images/RushDefense.png"><img src="images/RushDefense.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> The final graph subs in avg passing yds per game allowed into the x-axis. This graph does not have as strong 
										of a correlation as the rush yds graph did. The correlation is still linear and the best conferences are 
										near the top right of the graph, but not as prevalent as the prior graphs:
									</p>
									<a href="images/PassDefense.png"><img src="images/PassDefense.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Overall this analysis proved that defense does indeed win chamopionships as the main conferences that take home
										the national title, Big Ten and SEC, were in the top right of each graph. It was discovered that over the 
										four year period rush defense was more important and added more opportunity to win than a good pass defense did.
										Prioritizing controlling the clock and shutting down your opponents run defense would be the takeaway from this analysis, as 
										the best of the best in NCAA Football do it at a high level.
